# Inference and Conjunction Algorithms for Factor Graph Grammars

## Goal

The goal is to implement a library to work with factor graph grammars, special hyperedge replacement grammars that work with factor graphs. Factor graph grammars can be used to generate factor graphs of arbitrary size. The library should support inference and conjunction algorithms for factor graph grammars

## Installation

To install and use this library, download the source code and run `pip install -e .` in the top directory.

## Documentation

There is an extensive pdoc generated documentation for this library. A prebuild version can be found in the docs folder and can be accessed by simply opening the index.html file.

## Reference

The algorithms were originally proposed in the following paper:

Chiang, David, and Darcey, Riley. "Factor Graph Grammars." (2020).
