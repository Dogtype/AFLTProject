# Inference and Conjunction Algorithms for Factor Graph Grammars

## Goal

The goal is to implement a library to work with factor graph grammars, special hyperedge replacement grammars that work with factor graphs. Factor graph grammars can be used to generate factor graphs of arbitrary size. The library should support inference and conjunction algorithms for factor graph grammars

## Installation

Currently you can only download and use this library directely, but a setup might be provided to be able to use it with pip.

## Reference

The algorithms were originally proposed in the following paper:

Chiang, David, and Darcey, Riley. "Factor Graph Grammars." (2020).
